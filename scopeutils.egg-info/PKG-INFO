# here's what the code does

Structure:

scopeProject: contains all the code for cleaning data, classifying 10Ks, generating analysis files. Run the Python files from the root folder (prodScope), like this: 'python scopeProject/0_constructsample/0_get_10k_text.py'. This will make the path references consistent with 'setup.py'. 

scopeProject/0_constructsample: 
- download_files: this folder contains SAS Studio files for downloading data from WRDS. Since WRDS terms of service does
not allow me to upload the raw data files, I provide my code containing the download specifications.
- 0_clean_cs_crsp.py: cleans and merges Compustat firm panel with CRSP returns. Requires Compustat Fundamentals Annuals, 
Compustat Company file, Compustat-CRSP link file from WRDS, and CRSP monthly returns. See code file for more details. 
- 1_cik_gvkey_link.py: merges Compustat file from 0_clean_cs_crsp.py-> WRDS CIK-gvkey link file -> WRDS 10K database.
**This file should be run on WRDS JupyterHub. It extracts files from WRDS Cloud.** 
- 2_get_10k_text.py: scrapes items 1, 1a, and 7 from SEC database and adds missing flags. Requires API key; enter it in the file.
- 3_chunk_10k_text.py: splits the output file from 0_get_10k_text.py into 72 chunks to process in parallel (see embed_items below).


- Get 10k text and chunk it
- Embed 
- 
- 2_construct_intanStocks.py: uses methodology from EPW (year) to cumulate R&D and SG&A spending into intangible stocks. Requires Compustat Fundamentals Annual tables; place them into scopeProject/data/raw/compustat.

- embed_items: the files in this directory take the output from 1_chunk_10k_text.py and use the AnglE LLM to embed them into vectors.
Run these files on a High Performance Cluster to parallelize the necessary operations. The whole process took a few days on the 
Princeton HPC, but I don't recommend running these files without adjusting them to your specific cluster configuration.
